# Advent of Code 2019
This repository features solutions to the 2019 **Advent of Code** hosted on https://adventofcode.com/2019/about.

## About
For my second year doing Advent of Code, I chose to implement my solutions using the **C++** programming language in order to sharpen my
ability to write quick and efficient algorithms using the language's features.

Everything except Day 25 was completed over the winter break. I went back and completed the very last challenge at the end of April.
